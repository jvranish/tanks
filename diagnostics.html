    <h1>Tank Game Diagnostics</h1>
    <p>This provides an easy way to debug non-determinism issues in the game. On
    the host, after you've played a game for a while, you can click the
    "Download Diagnostics üõ†Ô∏è" button in the settings dialog to download
    diagnostics. You can then load those diagnostics here and this page will
    turn green if a replay of all events resulted in the same end states.</p>
    <p>If it turns red, then something went wrong, but you can debug what went
    wrong here without having to reproduce the problem live.</p>
    <p>The most common type of problem I run into here is accidentally mixing
    external state into GameState in <code>update()</code>. For example,
    accidentally using <code>Math.random()</code> instead of a pseudo-random
    number generator, who's state can be stored in the game state</p>
    <p>There are some sample diagnostics in <code>test-diagnostics.json</code></p>
